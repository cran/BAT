\title{Beta diversity partitioning using kernel density hypervolumes.}
\usage{
kernel.beta(comm, func = "jaccard", comp = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A 'HypervolumeList' object, preferably built using function kernel.build.}

\item{func}{Partial match indicating whether the Jaccard or Soerensen family of beta diversity measures should be used.  If not specified, default is Jaccard.}

\item{comp}{Boolean indicating whether beta diversity components (shared and unique fractions) should be returned}
}
\value{
Five pairwise distance matrices, one per each of the five beta diversity components. If comp = TRUE also three distance matrices with beta diversity components.
}
\description{
Pairwise beta diversity partitioning into replacement and net difference in amplitude components of n-dimensional hypervolumes.
}
\details{
Computes a pairwise decomposition of the overall differentiation among kernel density hypervolumes.
The beta diversity measures used here follow the partitioning frameworks developed by Podani & Schmera (2011), Carvalho et al. (2012) and Legendre (2019)
and later expanded to PD and FD by Cardoso et al. (2014), where Btotal = Brepl + Brich or Btotal = Bgain + Bloss.
Btotal = total beta diversity, reflecting both volume replacement and loss/gain;
Brepl = beta diversity explained by replacement of volume alone; Brich = beta diversity explained by volume loss/gain (richness differences) alone;
Bgain = beta diversity explained by volume gain from T1 to T2; Bloss = beta diversity explained by volume lost from T1 to T2.
See Carvalho & Cardoso (2020) and Mammola & Cardoso (2020) for the full formulas of beta diversity used here.
